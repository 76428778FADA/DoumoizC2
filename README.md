# DeimosC2
Deimos is in: __Beta__

DeimosC2 is a post-exploitation Command & Control (C2) tool that leverages multiple communication methods in order to control machines that have been compromised. DeimosC2 server and agents works on, and has been tested on, Windows, Darwin, and Linux. It is entirely written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) with a front end written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

### Listener Features
* Each listener has it's own RSA Pub and Private key that is leveraged to wrap encrypted agent communications.
* Dynamically generate agents on the fly
* Graphical map of listener and agents that are tied to it

### Agent Features
* Agent list page to give high level overview
* Agent interaction page containing info of agent, ability to run jobs against agent, filebrowser, loot data, and ability to add comments

### Supported Agents
* TCP
* HTTPS
* DoH (DNS over HTTPS)
* QUIC
* Pivot over TCP

### Frontend Features
* Multi-User support with roles of admin and user
* Graphs and visual interaction with listeners and agents
* Password length requirements
* 2FA Authentication using Google MFA
* Websocket API Calls
